My first game ever made. It was supposed to be computer version of [X-Wing Miniatures Game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing/). Unfortunately, at the time, I didn't have the knowledge about making multiplayer games, and the idea just didn't work with one computer, because other players shouldn't see other players choices.
